# Welcome {-}

This is the website for **"Introduction to Causality"**. This book will teach you the basics of causal inference: You will learn
* how **causal inference** differs from **statistical inference** or **prediction**.
* how to express these differences in **unambiguous mathematical notation** and **causal graphs**;
* a variety of techniques to probe causal questions, from **randomized controlled experiments** to **structural equation models**;
* the current scientific edge on causal analysis, including reinforcement learning.

The introduction will be gentle, beginning with the basic notion of causality in a non-probabilistic setting. Throughout the book, we will use modern notation and language, primarily following Pearl (2000).

The book further contains an extensive appendix containing code snippets in the statistical programming language R as well as auxilliary material on statistics. We hope that this will allow the book to be a good standalone source for all those interested in causality, whether or not they have a solid foundation in statistics.
