# Methods for Causal Inference

Causal relations can be inferred from **experiments** as well as **observational studies**.
The randomized controlled experiment is a proven method to infer causal relations in complex environments. It involves full control over the assignment mechanism and the assignment is random.
A common variation is the situation where the variable of interest cannot be directly intervened on, but a causal parent can. For example, a doctor can (randomly) prescribe a certain drug, but the patient still chooses to take the drug or not. The method of instrumental variables allows us to infer (local) causal effects nevertheless.

Afterwards, we switch to those methods that can be used even if we cannot intervene in the environment, but have to rely on passive observation only. Inferring causal relations in these situations requires a thorough understanding of the causal links from the variable of interest to the effect. We will study two different inference strategies which rely on different sets of assumptions.

Finally, we discuss methods for causal inference in samples of size 1. Given appropriate assumptions, we are able to infer causal relations by leveraging (dependent) observations over time.
